# RESTful_api


For the first startup check if you have installed all pips that you have in requirement.txt.
After that open terminal and run shell script ./server.sh
If it does not work than type in terminal chmod +x server.sh
After that it might be work.
Than open another terminal and run ./client.sh
If it does not work than type in terminal chmod +x client.sh
After that you have a simple restful api that use external api jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
Enjoy
